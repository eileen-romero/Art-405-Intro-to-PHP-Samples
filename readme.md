# Art 405 PHP Samples

Each folder contains a new concept to explor. The recommended order is as follows:

1. PHP Variables
2. PHP Arrays
3. PHP Functions
4. PHP Functions 2
5. PHP Functions 3

PHP is a very mature and well documented coding language with more functions than can ever be covered in a single class. Google is your friend in this case. For instance, what if you wanted to know how to capitalize the first letter of every word in a sentence? Google, &ldquo;php capitalize first letter of each words&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see the first result telling you to use a function called <code>ucwords()</code>, where the variable with your sentence goes into the parenthesis, for example: <code>ucwords($sentence)</code>. Ask questions on Slack as well!

Every exercise folder must be uploaded as its own GitHub project for this exercise. 

Good luck.
